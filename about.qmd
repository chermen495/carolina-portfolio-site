## 👋 About me {#about-me}

I'm Carolina Herrera, and the phrase that best defines me is: "I make things happen."

I am a determined and results-oriented professional who focuses all my efforts on efficiently achieving goals. I have a great ability to lead teams, guiding them toward excellence and success. I am a good listener, which allows me to thoroughly understand the expectations of individuals, teams, and companies, enabling me to design effective, relevant, and strategic solutions.

With a curious, motivated, and creative mindset, I specialize in retail marketing, event coordination, and customer loyalty. I aspire to lead innovative marketing strategies that generate a lasting impact on both companies and consumers, and I aspire to achieve a senior leadership position where I can advise teams, develop high-impact campaigns, create meaningful brand experiences, and support personal growth. <br><br><br><br>
